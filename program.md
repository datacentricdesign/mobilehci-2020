# Practical notes

* We will use Zoom as our video-conferencing platform, as it allows us to split into break-out rooms easily.
* We will use a Miro board as a shared working space for our participants to write down and share their experiences. We’ll prepare different areas on the board with instructions aimed at guiding the different phases.
* We will have 2-4 break-out groups (depending on the number of participants)
    * Each with at least one of the organizers participating and facilitating the format of the workshop
    * we’ll keep people in the same break-out groups throughout the workshop to avoid confusion
