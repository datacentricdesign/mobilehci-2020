The Internet of Things makes human activity data -- what people do, how they move, how they socialise -- 
an abundant resource. However, this rich and intimate perspective on people, which uniquely shape and 
characterise their behaviours, can have tremendous ethical implication if data is handled irresponsibly.
Being personal, contextual and accessible, mobile devices are key facilitators of (ir)responsible collection
and use of data. In this workshop, we will use the Future Workshop approach to develop a research agenda
towards ethical data-centric design of intelligent behaviours. As part of this approach, we will:
 
 1. criticise the current mechanisms and infrastructure to frame ethical challenges
 2. fantasise on futures which support user and designer values, and 
 3. implement a research agenda for the MobileHCI community to emphasise the barriers to tackle.
 
The outcomes of this workshop will foster ethical research and inspire the MobileHCI community.

# Goal of the Workshop

The goal of this 1-day workshop is to envision the design of mobile interactions that foster
ethical Data-Centric Design of intelligent behaviour. These interactions will be the
materialisation of mechanisms that support ethical use of human activity data to better
understand the role of mobile platforms in responsible Data-Centric Design of intelligent behaviours.
The workshop outcome will take the form of a MobileHCI vision to support ethical Data-Centric Design
approaches and a research agenda. We scope the workshop around three core moral values that relates to
technology from Value-Sensitive Design.

# Call for Participation

To participate in this workshop, send us a 2-page position paper in expressing your views,
experience or opinions towards ethical Data-Centric design of mobile systems. We invite
participation from all disciplines beyond HCI, including philosophy, social sciences and design.
